         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HEarken all ye People, and give Ear ye Nations of the Earth, for the Sword of the Lord is drawn forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt People and Nations, not a few; his Hand is lifted up in great Fury and Judgment againſt all Iniquity, and the provoking Abominations of the Times, which are grown to that height and degree, that the Almighty God now appeareth full of Indignation and Diſpleaſure againſt many People and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the Nations wherein God hath ſhewn moſt Love, and done moſt for, who ſtill remain Sinful, the Rebellious in that Nation will the Lord moſt puniſh and plead with in his Wrath: Where hath the Lord ſo much appeared, as in this Nation of <hi>England?</hi> hath he dealt in ſo much Loving-kindneſs and tender Mercies, to any People or Nation, as this our Native Country, wherein the mighty and glorious Day of God broke forth, and in theſe Ages of the World firſt proclaimed, and the Light of the glorious Goſpel that cauſed the Day to appear, faithfully and with much Power and Demonſtration preached, and the tender Viſitation of the Day ſprung from on high, reached forth univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in a very ſignal manner, and the ſound of the Goſpel in Life and Power, <hi>Love and Good-Will unto all men,</hi> was heard through this Nation, to call all People <hi>to Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ways and doings, to turn to the Lord, from all their grievous Sins and Iniquities</hi> [whilſt it was called to Day] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they grieved the Moſt high, rebelling againſt him, and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great love and favour in his Spirit ſtriving with them, the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> more than with any People or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever, under the preſent Diſpenſation of <hi>Light, Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ah! ye Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> how have many of you, even of all ſorts, ranks and degrees of Men and Women, ſlighted the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63805:3"/>diſpenſation of Light, Grace, and the Spirit of God, and the ſure, ſafe Teaching and Guidance thereof; for inſtead of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, ſome of you have taught others, to mock, laugh, and deride at the Light, Grace and Spirit of God, which appeared to you, and ſhined in your Hearts from God, to ſhew you what was really good and of God, from what was evil and of the evil one; and not only ſo, but alſo to teach you to deny, come out of, and be ſaved from that which was evil, and to chooſe, come into, and to do that which was and is good; and the juſt and merciful God did give you time to Repent, and endured all that you did againſt him with much long-ſuffering, that you might be become Veſſels of Mercy, and not Veſſels of Wrath by fitting your ſelves for deſtruction. But alas! how hath the Mercy and Forbearance of the Lord been abuſed? how have moſt of you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited him evil for good, and added Sin to Sin, for Mercies mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied upon this ſinful Nation; therefore now is the anger of the Lord kindled in Judgment againſt all ſuch, for now he is ſmiting, and will ſmite yet more and more, his Hand is dreadfully lifted up, and it will fall heavy upon the Head of the Wicked, where ever they are found, and whatſoever they profeſs, Amazement and Aſtoniſhment will be their portion, and their Hearts will fail them for fear, when the Iron Rod of the Lord is ruling of them, with which he will break the Wicked to pieces like a Potters Veſſel, that they may ſee and know the danger of multiplying provoking Sins againſt the Lord, till his long patience come to an end, if there yet may be hope, or a little time more alotted you; Ah, fooliſh People, and ſinful Nation, that at laſt you might come to conſider the great peril and danger that you are in, both high and low, rich and poor, who are Wicked and Ungodly, of <hi>all Sorts and Profeſſions,</hi> multiplying great Abominations, and committing manifold Tranſgreſſions againſt the Lord. What, are your Hearts ſo hardened through the deceitfulneſs of Sin, that you do not mind, nor at all conſider? Are your Eyes ſo blinded by the God of this World, that you do not ſee the heavy Hand of the Lord, that is ſo apparently lifted up, as if the Iniquities of the People of <hi>England</hi> would prove the Ruin of many of the Inhabitants thereof; could ever a Nation be more ſinful, or more loaden with Iniquity of all ſorts then this, a Nation ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing God, and that he hath done ſo much for their Salvation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63805:3"/>and a preſervation of? For what could the Lord have done more then he hath done for the good and benefit of <hi>England?</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding where can there be greater Wickedneſs or Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation committed? although many Nations are horribly wicked, and Cages of unclean Birds, who regard not the Work of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands: And though the dark pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Earth are full of Idolatry, blackneſs of Darkneſs and Cruelty, yet no <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> hath more <hi>provoked God,</hi> by ſinning againſt ſo much Knowledge, and ſo many Convictions &amp; Reproofs of Inſtruction from the manifeſtation of the <hi>Spirit, Light</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of God, appearing in you, and being given of God to you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal, that you might have been ſpared and ſaved in that woful day of Anguiſh and ſore Diſtreſs, that is come and coming upon Nations, inſomuch that many will cry out in bitterneſs of Spirit, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved? we have no helper that can help or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us:</hi> And the mighty Men of valour and ſtrength will grow feeble, and be full of Fears and Jealouſies one of another, and hide themſelves in the Holes and Dens of the Earth, and call to the Mountains and Hills to fall on them, and cover them from the Wrath of the Lamb, for his great Day, even the Day of his Vengeance and Hour of his Judgments now appeareth againſt all the Wicked and Ungodly of the Earth, without reſpect to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Opinions or Profeſſion whatſoever; and the Mountains and Hills, where many expect ſafety, will God Almighty ſhake, and lay waſte by his Power; for what are all Nations, Mountains or Hills [before the Lord] that riſe up againſt him; and if Bryars and Thorns ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, will he not break through them, &amp; conſume them together, who by his Omnipotent Power planteth and plucketh up Kingdoms and the Governments of this World as he pleaſeth, pulling down one and ſetting up another, that People may know and conſider, that the Moſt high rules in and over the Kingdoms of men, and he giveth them to whomſoever he pleaſeth, and is not accountable unto any man; for what he doth in the Kingdoms of this World, in laying waſte the greateſt Mountain or Hill, that riſeth up in oppoſition to the Honour and Glory of God, or the Exaltation of his Name in the Earth; for all ſuch the Judgments of the Lord will purſue, he will abaſe and pour Contempt upon them, although never ſo high and lifted up with earthly honour &amp; pleaſure of this world:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63805:4"/>We have ſeen already in this Age, how God hath laid that Honour, Pomp and Glory in the duſt, that Kings and Princes injoyed for a time, and their Pride and Glory, with the pride and glory of many others of lower degree, ſtained by the Judgment God hath brought upon them.</p>
            <p>O ſinful People! but how are they forgotten by you, and out of date with you as much as an old Almanack; the laſt great Plague in <hi>London,</hi> and many other places in <hi>England,</hi> whereof died ſo many Thouſands in a ſhort time, with that dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by that great Fire that came in <hi>London,</hi> which deſtroyed ſo many Houſes, and ſtately Buildings conſumed to Aſhes, or laid on heaps, and many Country-Towns alſo have felt the dreadful effects by Fire, to their great aſtoniſhment and loſs: Who hath taken warning by theſe heavy, ſevere Judgments, ſo as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their Wickedneſs, or turn to God? Where was your Weeping and bitter Lamentation for the evil you had done? For hath not Pride, Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Whoring, Revelling, Prophaneneſs, all manner of helliſh Words and debauched Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices abounded, and much increaſed ſince the before-mentioned Calamities laid ſo heavy upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other places in <hi>England,</hi> who have not taken warning thereby, to break from their Sins by timely Repentance, and ſhewing mercy to the poor? Ought you not to have loved God and your Neighbour without Diſſimulation? And ought not every one to do to another as they would be done unto? And have not many of you rather loſt that little of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which you ſometime ſeemed to have, then known any increaſe thereof, or been gainers in it? What <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, Self-ſeeking, Self-confidence, Self-exaltation,</hi> and ſaving that Life you have had in Death hath appeared in you? What have you laid down or left that is evil, which you formerly lived and walked in? 'Tis plain and evident that you are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Power and Prince of Darkneſs, who ſtill remain in your <hi>ungodly delights, wayes</hi> &amp; <hi>wicked practices.</hi> You wicked and ungodly Men and Women, both old and young, what loſs, what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable diſappointment are you come to, as to God, his Kingdom, or the World to come, to obtain a little eaſe in the Fleſh, with the pleaſures of Sin in this World, which you can enjoy but a little while or ſeaſon? Conſider Chriſt Jeſus, who denyed and abaſed himſelf, and would have no ſelf-pitty mentioned to him;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63805:4"/>when ſpeaking of his Sufferings and Death, he ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever ſhall lay down his Life for my ſake, the ſame ſhall find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you have been wanton upon the Earth, delighting your ſelves in the ſinful pleaſures of this world; many of you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared your Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Land mourns becauſe of Oaths, with other abominable and crying Sins; for the Iniquity of your Covetouſneſs God is wroth, his Wrath is kindled like Fire, which none can quench, againſt an <hi>Adulterous Generation, a Seed of Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, lying Children, and corrupters of the Earth, Deſtruction and Death is in their hands; but the way of Peace they know not,</hi> neither really deſire to know it, a People that ſeek not after God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay in their Hearts to him, <hi>Depart from us, we deſire not the Knowledge of thy Wayes;</hi> and too many are become ſo Atheſtical, that in effect they ſay, <hi>What is the Almighty to us, that we ſhould keep his Statutes, or walk mournfully before him?</hi> And how hath the Proud been called happy, the Wicked ſet up, and they that tempt God been delivered, the Prophets propheſie falſly, the Prieſts bear Rule by their Means, and ſuch as are blindly led by them even to love to have it ſo: But what will ye do in the end thereof? your Sorrow will be great that you will lay down your Heads in, both the blind Leaders, and ſuch as are led by them into the Ditch, their fall will be great together; great Woes and bitter Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will be the portion of ſuch, who remain always in that ſad ſtate of blindneſs and darkneſs, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, for the Eyes of the Lord are upon all the ſinful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to puniſh and deſtroy many People with great Puniſhments and ſore Deſtruction, becauſe ye have ſo long hardened your Hearts againſt the Lord; ye have ſet at naught his Counſel, and would have none of his Reproof; you have deſpiſed Knowledge, and would not chuſe the fear of the Lord; therefore great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity &amp; ſevere Judgments haſten, &amp; will come upon them that do not Repent; &amp; the Spirit of the Lord will not ſtrive much longer with many People in this and other Nations, but God will laugh at their Calamity, and mock when their Fear cometh. And I fear many are given up to hardneſs of Heart, and others appear as if their Conſciences were ſeared as with a hot Iron, paſſed all ſpiritual ſence and feeling, wholly captivated, and irrecoverably inſnared in the broad way, that leadeth to deſtruction, no Hand of God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63805:5"/>neither in Mercy or Judgment will reach them, to work them into any remorſe, ſorrow of Heart or Contrition, and by ſuch as hath an Eye opened to ſee, ſuch are ſeen to grow worſe and worſe, and further and further off from Repentance or Amendment of Life: May it not be ſaid of many of you, both Profeſſors and Prophane, <hi>That the beſt of you are but as a Bryar, and the moſt upright but as a Thorne Hedge, and great ſhall be your perplexity: and Wo to all deceitful Workers of Iniquity, Diſſemblers and Hypocrites, that would eat up God's People as they eat Bread; your expectation ſhall be cut off, your wicked Imaginations and Contrivances againſt the Juſt to ſlay him, will God fruſtrate and confound yet more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many wicked Men and Women of late have whetted their Teeth, and opened their Mouths, to eat up God's choſen Flock and Heritage, and devour them through Lyes, Calumnies and falſe Reports, ſpeaking all manner of Evil againſt ſuch, as neither thought, ſaid, or did any harm or evil to them. How have the Righteous been made the Song of Drunkards, debauched Swearers and Damners, who ſcarce could ſpeak, but in a Curſed and <hi>Danming</hi> manner? What ſcorn and deriſion hath the Juſt met with in theſe latter days, with the many Perils and Dangers on every ſide, and from all ſorts of wicked Men, Women and Children, is very well known to the Lord God, who is coming with Power to take Vengeance upon his Adverſaries, and to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all ſuch according to their works, you who are guilty every where, your wickedneſs will not go unpuniſhed, it will come upon your own Heads, and your treacherous dealing will purſue you, and fall heavy upon you, when the Righteous Judge ſhall judge and condemn you for it, the Lord will not ſpare ſuch, who in their abominable Pride, Debauchery and Filthineſs, walk the Streets as if they would out-dare the Moſt high that gave them Breath and Being in this world, with their Pride and Filthineſs.</p>
            <p>And now Deſtruction to the Wicked is threatned, how hath Fear ſurpriſed Multitudes? not the fear of God, but the fear of Deſtruction, or ſome other Evil to overtake them, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet nor at reſt; they diſturb and diſquiet one another, becauſe the <hi>Way of Peace is hid from their them;</hi> and alſo <hi>the Sinners in</hi> Sion <hi>are afraid, and fearfulneſs ſurpriſeth Hypocrites,</hi> who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide the day of the Lord's coming, nor ſtand when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, for his appearance is, and will be very dreadful to all

Go too now therefore, ye Rich Men, that truſt in uncertain Riches, and in an Arm of Fleſh, but not in the living God, Weep and Howle, for the Miſery that is coming upon you, who are lovers of Pleaſures more than lovers of God: And you that have oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed others, to advance your ſelves by defraud and diſhoneſt Gain, and wronged the Poor to ſet your Neſts on high, the Righeous Lord God will Viſit for theſe things, and Recompence the evil of your wayes and doings upon your Heads, if you do not ceaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and truly repent thereof, while you have time. Oh the manifold Provocations by which the Lord hath been, and ſtill is provoked to Wrath and Indignation, by a ſinful People and ſeed of Evil-doers, laden with Iniquity; and ſome are wiſe to do evil, become Serpents, and as a Generation of Vipers, in imagining and doing evil; but to do good, they have no knowledge; and it is ſad and grievous to ſee the Brutiſhneſs, Senſuallity and Devilliſhneſs many appeared in, filled with Envy and Enmity againſt that which is good, and them who keep therein, from day to day; and ſtill ſuch profeſs Chriſt Jeſus in words, <hi>and call him Lord and Maſter,</hi> but do not honour him, nor fear him, neither keep his Commands, but with their wicked works Spit upon him, Grucifie him afreſh again; and how hath he been put to ſhame all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> over, by them that ſeem to be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in words, but are not ſo in deeds?

My Heart truly is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and I am in pain to conſider of what I ſee coming upon this evil and untoward Generation now: O that they had an Ear open, and a Heart to underſtand the Voice of the Lord, and his Counſel to them, before it be to late, and the Door of Mercy and Favour from God be ſhut againſt them, that they might repent, that the Lord God may turn away his Wrath, that they periſh not; For the Sword of the Lord is drawn forth, forbiſhed, and made bright to make a ſore Slaughter in many Nations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by his Powerful Hand, although People will not ſee it when 'tis lifted up; they ſhall ſee it, and be aſhamed, aſtoniſhed and confounded, and by the immediate Hand of the Lord many People will fall, and be cut down as the Graſs, whilſt the carnal Sword alſo doth its part, what the Lord permits and ſuffers to be acted by it, in any flouriſhing City or ſtrong Nation; and he can raiſe up whomſoever he pleaſeth, as Inſtruments in his Hand, to make his Power known, that his Name may be declared throughout all the Earth; therefore he pulleth down one Prince and Potentate, and raiſeth up another in his ſtead, in the Kingdoms of this World,

A Righteouſneſs of your own you have gone about to eſtabliſh, and would eſtabliſh, which God will convince you of, and lead you out of by his own Spirit, and that will acquaint you with God's Righteouſneſs, that which is really of him, and is everlaſting, that you may poſſeſs that, and be eſtabliſhed in that, and not have on your own Righteouſneſs in your vain Imaginations; therefore will the Righteous God, by his appearance in Spirit convince the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63805:8"/>world of Judgment alſo; and the Prince of this World is judged, and the World's corrupt and erroneous judgment, through the appearance of the Spirit of Truth being received, it diſcovereth the World's judgment to be contrary to the judgment of Truth, and how the wrong judgment got up in the world, that ſo People may ſee the deceit and darkneſs of this World's judgment, and that they who are in it, have no judgment in their goings, ſuch have no right, divine or heavenly judgment, but are in the Prince of this World's dark judgment, that turneth againſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, and his Righteous Judgments, which are all true, juſt and faithful: And the Prince of Darkneſs, with his fallen Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Judgment, by the coming of the Lord, in judgment ſhall be judged and condemned by that which convinceth the World of Judgment; for what but the Spirit of Truth can judge the Spirit of Error? and what but the righteous judgment of the Spirit of Truth, that bringeth Man and Woman to ſee their <hi>deceit, falſhood</hi> and <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> to judge it down, and to ſave out of it? And indeed what but want of the ſence and feeling of this, that cauſeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſtumble at that that is good, even the pure Light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? and ſome do fall, and riſe not again, but fall into <hi>miſchief</hi> and <hi>violent dealing,</hi> and it purſueth them, and cometh upon them in the <hi>hour of God's Judgments, the Inhabitants of the Earth will learn Righteouſneſs:</hi> And what but the want of the judgment of Truth and Righteouſneſs is the cauſe that <hi>Error</hi> ſo long in the world hath been taken and paſſed for <hi>Truth;</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> hath been taken for <hi>Error,</hi> and condemned for it, People calling <hi>good evil,</hi> and <hi>evil good,</hi> putting <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> for <hi>Light:</hi> And therefore by the judgment of this world, it being dark, blind and erroneous, from Age to Age hath the Wicked been juſtified; and how have men endeavoured in moſt of the Governments of this World, <hi>to take away the Righteouſneſs of the Righteous from them,</hi> having judged rather according to outward appearance, then given Righteous Judgment in matters and Cauſes of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Religion and the worſhip of God; but ſuch as are in the judgment of Truth and Righteouſneſs, neither can nor will do ſo, but ſpeak of things, and judge with Righteous Judgment.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit of Truth being received, and continued in, it quickens the Soul, and giveth Spiritual Life to them that were dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes againſt God; therefore it ought
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63805:8"/>not to be vexed, grieved, or rebelled againſt, as it hath been to the great provocation of the Mogh high God, and kindling the fierce Wrath of a merciful and long-ſuffering God, who is ſlow to wrath, and of great kindneſs; how hath he been forgotten, and no more minded by many, than if he were no All-ſeeing God, but rather People have thought him like themſelves, who are wicked, as if God would not take any notice of their Ways and Doings, neither ſet their Sins and abominable Practices in order before them, and puniſh them for the ſame with a ſore deſtruction, who do not receive nor obey the Goſpel-offers of <hi>Salvation,</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Good-will towards mankind</hi> in general. Oh! how hath my Soul been often afflicted within me, becauſe of the <hi>Wickedneſs of the Wicked, diſebedient</hi> and <hi>ungodly Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> to ſee them even ſowing to the Fleſh, that hath ſo much appeared both in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo called, they having not minded the former Mercies nor Judgments that came from God, in love to them, &amp; care for their Souls well-fare, and that they might <hi>learn Righteouſneſs,</hi> when his Judgments were in the Earth, that People might not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſh in their gain-ſaying, and that his future Judgments threatning might be turned away. But Oh! how have you ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and provoked God more and more, with greater and greater Evils? What will it avail any of you to come before the Lord, or to draw night to him with their Tongues and Lips, whilſt your Hearts are afar off from him, and gone a Whoring from him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Idols, ſet up in your Hearts; or whether any Idol of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold, any Creature, or outward thing, which can ſave no man or woman's Soul, nor is able to hide or deliver you in the day of God's Wrath and Indignation againſt a wicked and untoward Generation, ought not to be put away, becauſe of the blackneſs of ſuch. Now <hi>Deſolation, Perplexity, Wo,</hi> and <hi>great diſtreſs of Nations haſteneth,</hi> and is even ready to come upon many People and Nations, but eſpecially Nations and Peoples that God hath loved and done moſt for, and moſt appeared in, by the Light of his glorious Goſpel of Grace and Truth, that the ſame have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſinned againſt, and walked contrary to, ſuch will the Lord ſhew moſt diſpleaſure againſt, and puniſh moſt ſeverely, when his Hand is lifted up to ſmite, hew down, and thin the People, and to bring down the abominable Pride and Haughtineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in all Nations; for he will make all Nations tremble and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63805:9"/>bow before him, <hi>Aſtoniſhment, Fear</hi> and <hi>Trouble</hi> on every ſide will appear, when the Righteous Judge will plead with all Fleſh in the way of his Judgments, being wroth, and cometh to puniſh the Inhabitants of the Earth for their Iniquity: Who ſhall ſtand before him, or who ſhall ſtop him, or prevent the Execution of his Wrath upon the Ungodly?</p>
            <p>Therefore, O all ye <hi>wicked</hi> &amp; <hi>ungodly</hi> of the Earth, be ye warned, be ye warned; Repent, Repent, and come to a Godly Sorrow for all your evil wayes and doings, and turn to the Lord with your Hearts rent; for what will the renting of your Garments profit you, whilſt your Hearts are not rent nor broken before the Lord, but you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as whole in your Sins as ever you were, and your Hearts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened thereby more than ever. Now there is no other way for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Nations to appeaſe the Wrath of God, and turn away his Judgments, threatning them for Sin, but for all wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to take warning in time, by former Warnings, Judgments and Calamities; and what Nation is there in the Earth, where God's Voice is not heard in Judgment, when his Goodneſs, Mercy and Favours are abuſed and ſleighted? for before God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in his fierce Wrath. And all you that would eſcape Miſeries and Calamities, feel and bear the Indignation of the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly for Sin and Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Put away the evil of your wayes and doings from before his Eyes,</hi> who hath an all-ſeeing Eye, and ſeeth all the Wayes and Doings of all Men and Women, both High and Low, Rich and Poor, in every Nation throughout the World. And now the Hand of the Lord is lifted up in Judgment, and the Lord is ſmiting the Inhabitantes of the Earth and the Sea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and thining the People by the Sword, and ſore Deſeaſes. And what a terrible <hi>Storm</hi> and <hi>Tempeſt</hi> hath the Lord diſtreſſed and amuzed many with of late, both by Sea and Land? yet ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been ſo far from looking at the Hand of the Lord in it, that they would have it as the work of ſome evil Spirit, in laying a Spirit, that, as they ſaid, did appear after a Perſon was dead. The Power over the Winds and Seas belongeth to Chriſt Jeſus, and the Winds and Seas obey him; for he had all Power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth committed to him, and gives Power to his faithful Servants over Serpents, Scorpions, and all the Power of the Enemy; &amp; to hear &amp; ſee ſo many diſregard the Hand of the Lord lifted up, ſheweth that it will fall heavy ſhortly upon their <hi>heads,</hi> who remain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63805:9"/>wicked, and by their <hi>crying Sins,</hi> bring down Vengeance from God upon their own Heads, and procure their own ruin, for God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence Fury upon his Enemies, who harden their Hearts more and more againſt him; and now is the Lord come to make Nations and Peoples ſick in ſmiting of them, he hath a long time forborn and kept his Hand of Judgment from falling upon the Heads of the wicked, according to their deceit &amp; their manifold Sins, to ſee Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) if you would turn to the Lord by true Repentance; but ye would not hear his Voice to obey him, how often ſoever the Lord called to, and by how many Judgments ſoever he hath pleaded with you, you would not reform, therefore the Lord doth appear in great diſpleaſure, and is ſhaking the Earth, and cauſing the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Hills to tremble; he is making Kingdoms reel, and toſſing and fifting them, to lay them low, ſtain their Glory, and bring them down from that height that they are got to, and have appeared in againſt the Lord and his holy Mountain, which abides and ſtands ſtrong through him that is over all, bleſſed for evermore.</p>
            <p>O all ye wicked and ungodly People, upon the face of the Earth, your time is but ſhort, your dayes in Wickednsſs will be ſhortened; 'tis but a little time, and you will not be found, who go on and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in wickedneſs, and never come to Repentance, your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reward of Condemnation will come upon you ſwiftly, and you will not be able to withſtand it, whoever you are, high or low, rich or poor, where-ever you dwell, that have ſold your ſelves over, and are given up to work Wickedneſs, the all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God will find you out, and will be juſt in condemning of you to everlaſting Flames of Fire, and that will be your Portion and Reward that you will receive at the Hand of the Lord, who hath appeared to you in his Grace and Truth, in your inward parts, and condeſcended to draw you by the Cords of his Love; but you have deſpiſed and utterly rejected his appearance to you in his Grace, whereby you might have obtained Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your immortal Souls, if you had received God's Grace and Truth into your Hearts, and kept to its Teachings, and obeyed the ſame, or done according to its Inſtruction; but contrary-wiſe, you have hated his Appearance to reform you, and wofully conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Rebellion againſt his pure Law: ſo you have drawn down the <hi>Wrath of the Lord upon you</hi> and <hi>kindled his Diſpleaſure</hi> againſt you in a high degree, by your manifold <hi>provoking Sins,</hi> which many Cities and Nations abound in, and very many of the Inhabitants

            <p>But if all <hi>People, Languages, Kindreds</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> would come to fear and love God, and love one another, then their would be no need of letting in Fear or evil Jealouſie one of another, or of one to hurt or deſtroy another by Wars or Fightings, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for all were made and created to love, fear, and reverence the Powerful Omnipotent God, and to let him be their fear, and not man, neither to fear what man can do; and if ſo, then Wars and Fightings would ceaſe with Carnal Weapons, then Kings and Princes, and their Subjects would learn to be quiet, peaceable, and love one another, indeed and in truth, which would make Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons happy and flouriſhing Kingdoms, and they would learn War no more, but beat their Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into pruning Hooks, and Peoples Fleſhly Luſts would dye, which doth ſo often, and ſo much prompt Peoples and Nations, to Wars and Fightings, but Chriſt's Doctrine and Example all People ought to mind and follow, who command his Followers, <hi>to love their Enemies, as well as to love another; and to do good to them that did hate them, and to pray for ſuch as diſpitfully uſed and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them,</hi> and in ſo doings we manifeſt our ſelves to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our heavenly Father, who cauſeth the Sun to ſhine and the Rain to fall both upon the <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>

Now it is as if I heard the noiſe of Trumpets ſounding, and Drums beating an Alarm to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in many <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> and the Sword drawn, to execute the Wrath of God, for Sin and Tranſgreſſion, by the ungodly committed, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Almighty God, who now will ſhew himſelf a terrible God, to the <hi>Workers of Iniquity,</hi> by <hi>Wars, Famine</hi> and <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> with other <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Calamities,</hi> that God will bring upon many Cities and ſtrong Nations, to bring down their Pride and Haughtineſs and to abaſe them, for their ſleighting and Contemning his Appearance, in the Light of his Glorious Goſpel, which ſhines in their Hearts, to give them the Knowledge of the Glory of God, to humble you under his mighty Hand, that all might turn to him, who ſmites and corrects Men and Women, that they might ſee his Hand, and acknowledge his Power, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity over all, and what we can do, with ſtrong and fenced Cities; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with all Nations, that are but as the drop of a ſucket, and the ſmall duſt of the Ballance, to the Lord and his ſtrength and great Power, when in his ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, he gives them up to the <hi>Sword, Famine,</hi> or <hi>Peſtilence:</hi> how ſoon can he make of a fair and flouriſhing City on heaps, and a ſtrong City a deſolation, when they Inhabitants thereof will not be reformed, from the evil of their Ways and doings, nor Repent of the ſame? how often hath the Lord brought Plagues and heavy Judgments upon ſuch Cities and Nations? how glad ſhould I be to ſee the Inhabitants of England in general, and the City of <hi>London</hi> in perticular, bringing forth Fruits meet for Repentance, that they would whilſt they have time be Afflicted, Mourn and Weep, for the great Evils that daily are committed by many of them, that your <hi>Laughter might be turned into Mourning,</hi> and <hi>your Joy into Heavineſs,</hi> that thoſe great Calamities, which threatens, both City and Nation, the merciſul God might turn away from my Native Country, and every Inhabitant may be humbled for their Tranſgreſſions, that the Lord may repent of the Evil that doth ſo much threaten this and many other Kingdoms: O that there were ſuch a Heart in all People of all Nations, that they would ſeek after the living God, and that they might know him, and receive everlaſting Liſe by Chriſt Jeſus, and leave off doing Evil, and learn to do Well, that inſtead of hating and killing one another about Religion, and worldly Glory and Honour, they might feel the Love of God ſhed abroad in their Hearts, and in that love God above all, and one another, as the Children and Off-ſpring of God; for all Nations upon the face of the Earth, being of one Blood, made by the great and heavenly Creator, all were created by him, to fear, reverence, and ſerve the eternal God.</p>
            <p>So, all you who do pretend that you are Servants of God and Chriſt Jeſus, ſear reverence, ſerve and obey him, in a meaſure of that Love of God, wherewith he hath loved you and all mankind, and deſireth the Salvation of all men, and not the death or deſtruction of the Wicked, but rather that they would turn from their Wickedneſs, and live for evermore, to ſerve, worſhip, and obey the living God, whoſe Servants you call your ſelves, and think you worſhip him, and ſerve him whilſt you are out of his holy Spirit, and Godly Fear, in your vain ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous ways of Worſhip, which are ſo unprofitable, and of no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refit ſpiritually to you, that vainly pretend to worſhip the living God, who is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped and ſerved in the Spirit, and in the Truth, as it is in Jeſus; for their is no other acceptable worſhip or ſerving of God, but in his holy Spirit and Truth, which the Devil is out of, and all his Servants, are erred
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63805:13"/>from the Spirit of God, and doth imagine that God acceptably may be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſerved well enough by them, is another Spirit than his own holy Spirit; then it muſt be an unholy Spirit, in which you can offer toe God no Worſhip or Service, but what is vain, unprofitable and unholy, which is rejected of the Lord God, as but vain worſhipping of him; and for this many ſpend their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Labour many Years together, but gain no advantage or ſatisfaction to their immortal Souls, being from the Spirit of God and Word of Life that was in the beginning, and which is eternal, ſo obtain not Life or true ſatisfaction to their Souls, and therefore cannot livingly move, or act ſpiritually in the ſervice or worſhip of God, but it ſeemeth to them as a ſtrange thing, and the pure God hath but blind and dead ſervice and worſhip from ſuch; and indeed it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that ſo many wiſe and learned men in Arts, Sciences, and natural Tongues are unskilled and ignorant in ſpiritual waiting upon, ſerving and worſhipping the living God, whilſt they queſtion, whether any doth receive from God the gift of the holy Spirit now in theſe dayes; then let ſuch men in coolneſs of mind conſider, with what they adventure to ſerve and worſhip God, and approach before him, not receiving the ſpirit, but will draw nigh to God, ſerve and worſhip him out of the ſpirit; and what may you expect who are in that deplorable ſtate, but that the Lord ſhould ſay unto you, <hi>Who hath required ſuch Worſhip or Service from you?</hi> now in this Goſpel day, the ſpirit of God being poured fourth; Do you think (People) that God will be mocked with ſuch ſervice or worſhip to be offered to him, that doth appear but the fruits of the Fleſh, or ſowing to the Fleſh? O that you would come to ſee, and ſeriouſly conſider that the Fleſh profiteth nothing, nor any of the fleſhly motions, ways, ſervices or worſhips of fallen man, performed in the Wiſdom of the Fleſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though performed in never ſo much skill and cunning outwardly, can give man acceptance with the Lord, nor can at all give Life to the Soul, for its the ſpirit that giveth Life, and this Spirit firſt muſt be received by you, and work in your Hearts to will and to do, before your Hearts can be fitted or prepared, to ſerve or worſhip God acceptably: ſo all of you wait upon God for his holy ſpirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it into your Hearts, and no longer reject it, but in the ſilence of all Fleſh feel the ſpirit of God to quicken your mortal Bodies, that in and by the ſpirit you to God may preſent your Bodies to him, and draw night to him with your Flearts fitted, and ſpiritually prepared, to offer to God ſpiritual ſacrifice, holy and acceptable in his ſight, who cannot be pleaſed with Iniquity, nor the Works of it, in their ſervice or worſhip; for Sin and Iniquity muſt be done away, before you can graciouſly be received of the Lord, or know how to render to him the calves of your Lips, or draw nigh to him aright with your Tongues or Lips? why ſhould you hate to be reformed, or caſt off from you that which is good, to cleave to the evil, and periſh therein?
